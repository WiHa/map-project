  <h1>Diminishing Marginal History</h1>
  <div id="features"><strong>Featuring:</strong> A quote randomiser. (Look! It's up there! A tad of theory to how this project came about.)</div><br>
  <h3>What's that mappy thing all about?</h3>
  <h2> A very generalising, embarissingly not-in-depth explanation </h2>
  <p> This project is a research in progress, an attempt to approach choice making and theories of choice making as a cultural objects. 
  What do they tell us about the way we see the world? How do we make decisions and what is lost when we do? What do theories of choice explain, and
  what don't they account for?</p>
  <p>The map shows you histories that have been diminished, or obscured. Sometimes intentionally, but possibly more so because 
  dominant discourses help us choose a different historical canon.</p>
  <p>The map helps to visualise that when you make a choice for one history, you also don't choose a lot of others. Each time you click a marker, it turns green. Yet, the point is not the green marker, but rather all the markers that remain red! Each time you choose, you also choose to not choose something else. <br>
  This is of course true for any choice you make. Theories of choice, like game theory, decision theory and social choice theory help us theorise about choices in more complex situations. However, all these theories assume that all choices are made from the individual either within or without complex surroundings. All of them are choices based upon selfishness: when faced with an option you will choose the best possible outcome for yourself, taking in account other actors that may affect you, and they theorise about the possible outcomes (win-win, zero-sum etc.)<br>
  Obviously, these theories are true, at least to some degree, but within the studies of decision-making the idea of discourse and cultural embeddedness has been neglected, and hence these theories do not speak of such things or focus upon the choices that are not made, and why they are not made. To me, the latter is at least as interesting. When you don't take into account cultural backgrounds and discursive powers, then why would we know so much more about the history of white, male, heterosexual, able-bodied people, and are hardly in the know about histories of people of colour, gays, women and people with disabilities? It is that discrepancy in the different choice theories that this map shows. It is a term called 'Diminished Marginal Utility', stating that 
  when a person increases consumption of a product, while keeping consumption of other products constant there is a decline in the marginal utility that that
  person derives from consuming each additional unit of that product. In other words, we couldn't add all histories to a canon, because their meaning would decrease with each extra history that is added. As such, we must choose some histories, but choose those that are most relevant to 'us'. And that 'us', you've guessed it, is largely dependent on the dominating discourse.</p>
  
  
  <br><div class="smallheader">Features that could be added: </div>
  <ul class="list">
  <li> Extra markers with more famous histories, to stress the point. </li>
  <li> Data-collection: Collecting and storing data of users of the map. What histories do people choose? </li>
  <li> With that data: use data on map to create temporality: for instance markers could be more or less opaque depending on how often they've been chosen </li>
 	 <ul class="list">
 		 <li> The data could be used for analysis to draw more generalised conclusions: why do people (if so) choose the same histories. Do rational choice, social choice and game theory as referring to an individual agent actually hold? </li>
 		 <li> If not (and my hypothisis is that it's not 'just' individuality), what are the other players? </li>
 	 </ul>
  <li> Make the map a multiplayer map with a game element. You could get roles assigned and specific aims to get a certain history in the canon. </li>
  <li> Alternatively, a multiplayer version could be a prisoner's dilemma type game, where you could be asked to apply different strategies such as 'cooperative', 'tit for tat', 'defect' or 'unforgiving'. The algorithm for the possible outcomes is mathematically quite difficult though, and I would need to find a way to make the point of the map stand out. Not sure if this is the way to go with it. </li>
  <li>Based upon a theatre performance called 'The Money' by Seth Honnor, create a live multiplayer version where people are given a set amount of time to settle on a selection of histories that will be saved whilst the others will be lost. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/apr/14/the-money-a-nations-theatre-battersea-arts-centre-london">About 'The Money'</a> </li>
