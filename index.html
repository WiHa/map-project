                        <br />

                        <p style="font-size:22px;">It's a map. It's code. It's history. It's research in progress. More importantly though, it's an assignment to you: You have to pick five histories on this map. Five. No more, no less.<br>
                        The rest of them will solely be remembered by a small group of historians. For the larger audience it will be like these things never happened, like these people never existed.<br>
                        That's just the way diminished marginal utility works: too much of everything decreases the value of each seperate item. So, do you think you know what you know because it's important? Or is it important because everybody knows it?<br>
                        Will you choose what you know already? Or will you look beyond and choose a gay, female, disability or slave history? It's your decision, so good luck and happy choosing!

                        <p style="font-size:20px;"> P.S.: Not all functionality is working. The 'Choose' button in the popups is not yet activated, but let's pretend it is.<br>
                        P.P.S.: You can close popups on their close button, or by clicking anywhere on the map that's not a marker.</p>
